# Helpers Module Documentation

This document describes the purpose, architecture, and usage of helper functions in the AlexJSully Portfolio project, with technical details and integration patterns.

## 📦 Purpose

Helpers provide reusable utility functions for formatting, logic, and data manipulation. They help keep components clean and focused on UI, separating business logic from presentation.

## 🏗️ Structure

- Location: `src/helpers/`
- Example files:
    - `ascii.ts`: Generates ASCII art for branding and fun UI elements.
    - `aaaahhhh.ts`: Custom logic for playful UI interactions.
- Test files:
    - `ascii.test.ts`: Unit tests for ASCII art generation.
    - `aaaahhhh.test.ts`: Tests for custom logic.

## 🔍 Usage Examples

### ASCII Art Helper

```ts
import { asciiArt } from '@helpers/ascii';

console.log(asciiArt('Portfolio'));
```

### Custom Logic Helper

```ts
import { aaaahhhh } from '@helpers/aaaahhhh';

const result = aaaahhhh('Hello!');
```

## 🧩 Integration & Relationships

- Helpers are used by components and layouts for formatting, logic, and data manipulation.
- All helper functions are tested with Jest for reliability.
- TypeScript interfaces ensure type safety and documentation.

## 🛠️ Extending Helpers

- Add new helpers in `src/helpers/`.
- Write unit tests for each helper function.
- Use path aliases (`@helpers/`) for clean imports.

💡 **Tip:** Add new helpers in `src/helpers/` and write tests for each function. Use TypeScript for type safety and maintainability.
